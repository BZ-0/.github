# Important Announcement

I realize you miss all my and our projects like BCom2 and its little utilities. And that you feel that hope is kind of dead, as well as the whole project. But as of February 2024, I decided that I would secretly develop a dedicated UI/UX Frontend and PWA project by 2025. At that time, I'll introduce a whole bunch of heavily updated libraries, well tested and honed. In addition, it will also be a kind of Android shell simulator (launcher or home-screen). Regarding the Comlink alternative, I'm also planning a complete redesign, and by version 3.0, where there will definitely be a complete breakdown into modules and components, and even a whole meta-programming. Unfortunately, I will not be able to fully present the idea of supporting JNG and JXL, as well as other graphic formats (images), also due to lack of time or motivation/desire.

## Possible functionalities

At the beginning it's worth noting that only the first part is in development so far, namely the home screen or desktop (icons) with its settings and color schemes. The design is inspired by Material Design 3 (material you) with its adaptability and some ideas from other designs like Fluent. Other applications or parts will be recreated already in the next projects...

## Adaptability and mobility

The design will be adapted first for terminals, mobile devices, tablets, and only lastly for desktops and laptops. Although I still plan to support keyboards and mice, as well as styluses.


# Intendant L1 (IDX-L1)

## Generated by AI (Chad-GPT)

IDX L1, a core component of the **Intendant OS** family, embarks on a pioneering journey to redefine the essence of design and functionality within the realm of operating systems and user interfaces. Inspired by the evocative principles of **Material Design 3 (Material You)**, IDX L1 integrates a dynamic and personalized approach to design, allowing for a deeply customizable experience that resonates with the user's style and preferences.

## Design Philosophy
At the heart of IDX L1 lies a commitment to a seamless, fluid, and adaptable design ethos. Drawing inspiration from an array of influential design systems, including **Fluent Design, Xiaomi/MIUI/HyperOS**, and others, IDX L1 harmonizes these influences into a unique, coherent visual language. Key to this endeavor is the implementation of light and dark themes, enabling users to choose the aesthetic that best suits their mood or needs, while also prioritizing eye comfort and accessibility.

The design further explores the possibilities of HDR and AMOLED displays, with a focus on delivering vivid, lifelike colors and deep contrasts that make every interaction a delight. To achieve this, the primary color model currently employed is **oklch**, with plans to explore and incorporate more advanced color models to enhance visual fidelity and user experience.

## Technical Architecture
IDX L1 is crafted with a modular and asynchronous model at its core, which redefines how the DOM operates by emphasizing dynamic interactions over static engagements. Event handling is sophisticatedly designed to support various implementation strategies, such as binding to specific selector representatives, employing delegation, or targeting directly, thus offering flexibility and efficiency in response to user actions.

This architecture lays the foundation for the development of a desktop/launcher/environment envisaged as a Web application or Progressive Web App (PWA), signifying IDX L1's commitment to creating an environment that is inherently adaptable and responsive across different device categoriesâ€”mobile phones, tablets, terminals, and to a lesser extent, desktops and laptops.

## Platform and Development Environment
IDX L1 is primarily developed and tested on **Chrome Canary** or **Edge Canary**, leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities enabled by their experimental features. While the framework includes certain fallback mechanisms, these are not the majority, pointing to a forward-looking, modern web technologies-driven approach.

The development stack eschews conventional frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and even jQuery, opting instead for innovative tools such as `ejs` for templating, `scss` for styling, and an embrace of web components to architect a clean, efficient, and scalable system.

## Build and Server Architecture

In pursuit of an optimized and efficient development workflow, IDX L1 harnesses the power of **Webpack** for project bundling. This strategic choice enables a streamlined build process, facilitating the transformation and packaging of assets, modules, and libraries into a cohesive, deployment-ready structure. Webpack's versatile plugin system and loader support empower IDX L1 to efficiently manage dependencies and static assets, ensuring a smooth development experience and a robust production build.

Complementing the build process, **Fastify** has been selected as the server framework of choice for its high performance and low overhead characteristics. Fastify's emphasis on speed and its rich ecosystem of plugins make it an ideal companion for developing lightweight and fast server-side applications. Although IDX L1 is currently designed to operate primarily in an offline setting, Fastify lays the groundwork for potential future expansions where server-side rendering, API interactions, or other server-dependent features might be explored.

This dual approach, combining Webpack's comprehensive build capabilities with Fastify's efficient server management, underpins IDX L1's dedication to leveraging modern technologies to enhance development experience and end-user interaction. It signifies a foundational commitment to not only embracing but also mastering contemporary tools that define and drive the future of web application development.

## Roadmap and Vision
The development of IDX L1 is a solo venture, driven by a blend of passion, creativity, and the desire to fill leisure time with meaningful engagement. The projected minimal viable product (MVP) is earmarked for release by 2025, demonstrating a commitment to thoughtful, incremental development. This journey is not just about building an OS or a UI; it's about crafting an experience, a narrative that will be a testament to what one can achieve with vision and perseverance.

IDX L1 is more than a project; it's an idea, an exploration, aimed at the future of user interfaces and interactions. This endeavor is chronicled as a special portfolio, each line of code, each design decision, reflecting a step towards redefining how we engage with digital environments.

Stay tuned for updates on this ambitious project, as it slowly unfolds into a comprehensive solution that blends style, substance, and technology into one cohesive and revolutionary user experience.
